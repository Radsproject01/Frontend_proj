<p>This is going to be a paragraph from wiki about the pixel art:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art">
Pixel art is a form of digital art drawn with graphical software where images are built using pixels as the ony building block.
It is widely associated with the low-resolution graphics from 8-bit and 16-bit era computers, arcade machines and video game consoles, in addition to other limited systems such as LED displays and graphing calculators, which have a limited number of pixels and colors available.
The art form is still employed to this day by pixel artists and game studios, even though the technological limitations have since been surpassed.
